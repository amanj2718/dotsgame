========

My attempt to learn AI in games.

To play :-

1) Install python - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-278/

2) Install pygame - http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame (For Windows). Use your package manager on Linux and Mac.

3) Download zip and extract to a convenient location. Open your prompt, and cd to the location you extracted and run

python dots.py

4) Play with the AI or multiplayer!
